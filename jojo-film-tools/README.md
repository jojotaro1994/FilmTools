Jojo Film Tools
Welcome to Jojo Film Tools! This is a web-based application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to help screenwriters and directors visually plan their projects. It provides a powerful interface for script analysis, emotion tracking, and storyboard creation.

Features
Table & Analysis View: A detailed table for your script segments.

Editable Script: Directly edit script text in-line.

Hierarchical Structure: Add, delete, indent, and outdent script lines with automatic numbering (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1).

Emotion Tracking: Visually edit emotion values (Interest, Tension, etc.) for each scene using interactive sliders.

Customizable Emotions: Add or remove the emotions you want to track via a simple pop-up menu.

Storyboard View: A separate, dedicated space to visually plan your shots.

Grid & List Layouts: View your storyboard panels in a flexible grid or a detailed list.

Aspect Ratio Control: Switch between widescreen (16:9), square (1:1), and vertical (9:16) aspect ratios for your image panels.
